# HistoricalWeather

As someone always fascinated by weather trends, I built this application to allow users to enter a zipcode and get historical weather data for any location by connecting with a public API. 

**Built with:** C#, ASP.NET Core

*Note: This is currently a work in progress with the UI coming soon...*
